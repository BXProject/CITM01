# CAN In The Middle 01 - Proof of concept

## About the Project

In order to interact with a vehicles data network, I needed to create a CAN Bus adapter.
This initial project is a proof of concept to see if an Arduino is capable enough to interact with a vehicles CAN Bus and relay data back to a PC.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

This projects assumes the use of an Arduino Pro Mini and a TJA1050 CAN Bus shield
